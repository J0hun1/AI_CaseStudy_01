# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - Case Study

This repository contains the case study project for the subject **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CS 17)**. The project involves using a dataset from Kaggle to compare the performance of three different machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Student Sleep Patterns** dataset from Kaggle. This dataset provides information about the sleep patterns of students, which we will use to train and evaluate our models.

## Algorithms

We will be comparing the following three algorithms:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**

## Objectives

- Preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for training the models.
- Train and evaluate the performance of each algorithm.
- Compare the results to determine which algorithm performs best on this dataset.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and any data preprocessing scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CS-17-Introduction-to-Artificial-Intelligence-Case-Study
   ```
3. Update pip with:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn lazypredict scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of KNN, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree algorithms using the Student Sleep Patterns dataset. By the end of this case study, we hope to gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of this specific dataset.
